# RapidApi-ApiConsume

Hotelier API
I developed the project with Asp.Net Core 7.0 and successfully implemented a hotel project in which I used the Api in the Backend and consumed this Api in the Frontend.

The main technologies I use in the project are:
.NET CORE 7.0
Using N-Tier Architecture
Repository Design Pattern
Asp.Net Identity
Database Transactions with Entity Framework Core
Rapid Api and Api Consume
Fluent Validation Procedures
Data Transfer Object (Dto)
AutoMapper
Authentication and authorization with Json Web Token
